Python library for analyzing musical temperaments. Created by Andrew C. Smith
(http://www.andrewchristophersmith.com) for musical research.

Requirements:

	* numpy
	* matplotlib (for plotting)
	* nose (for testing)

In addition to some basic analytical functions, temperament includes a very
small catalog of historical and new temperaments. I hope to expand this.

This library is subject to change at any moment based on whimsy.
